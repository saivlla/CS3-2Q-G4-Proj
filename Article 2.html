        <h2>What are the Effects of Water Pollution?</h2>
        <p>
           Water pollution is a critical global issue that impacts the environment,
		human health, and economies. Contaminated water sources are a leading 
		cause of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, 
		claiming thousands of lives each year, especially in regions with limited
		access to clean water. The immediate health effects are severe, but long-term
		exposure to polluted water can lead to chronic illnesses, including neurological 
		disorders and cancers, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems and communities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The food chain is also adversely affected by water pollution. 
		Pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, and microplastics
		accumulate in aquatic organisms, including fish and shellfish,
		which are then consumed by humans. This bioaccumulation poses 
		serious health risks and threatens food security, as contaminated
		seafood can lead to various health issues.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Additionally, the tourism and recreational sectors suffer due 
		to water pollution. Degraded water quality diminishes the
		aesthetic appeal of natural landscapes, leading to reduced 
		visitor numbers and economic losses for communities reliant
		on tourism. Addressing water pollution is essential for
		safeguarding public health, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring 
		sustainable economic growth. For more information on water
		pollution and its impacts, consider exploring resources from 
		organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
		the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
