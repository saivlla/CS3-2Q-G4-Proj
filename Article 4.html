        <p>Water pollution endangers ecosystems, health, and economies. Effective solutions require coordinated actions such as:</p>

        <div class="solution-section">
	    <p>
		 Water pollution poses significant threats to ecosystems,
		    human health, and economies. Addressing this issue
		    requires coordinated actions across multiple sector.
		    Improve Wastewater Treatment: Upgrading wastewater 
		    treatment systems with advanced technologies, such
		    as membrane filtration and biological treatments,
		    can effectively remove harmful chemicals and pathogens
		    from sewage and industrial waste. Properly treated water
		    not only protects ecosystems but also reduces health 
		    risks for communities.
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>
		 Reduce Plastic Pollution: Minimizing the use of single-use 
		    plastics is essential. Encouraging biodegradable alternatives
		    and enhancing recycling systems can significantly decrease
		    plastic waste. Additionally, organizing cleanup campaigns
		    to remove plastic debris from rivers and oceans helps protect 
		    marine life.Sustainable Agriculture: Implementing eco-friendly
		    farming practices can reduce the runoff of pesticides and
		    fertilizers into water bodies. Techniques such as organic
		    farming, establishing vegetative buffer zones, and utilizing 
		    precision agriculture can significantly lower water contamination.

            <b>Stormwater Management</b>
            <p>Stormwater carries pollutants from urban areas into water bodies. Green infrastructure like rain gardens, retention basins, and 
               permeable pavements can filter out contaminants and reduce waterway pollution.

            <b>Public Awareness</b>
            <p>Educating communities about water conservation and pollution prevention fosters accountability. 
               Organized cleanups and public campaigns encourage collective responsibility and behavior change.

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Stronger Policies</b>
            <p>Governments must enforce laws on waste disposal, regulate industrial/agricultural practices, and incentivize sustainable technologies. 
               Penalties for violations and subsidies for eco-friendly innovations are critical.
